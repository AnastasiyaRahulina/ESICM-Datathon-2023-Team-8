# ESICM-Datathon-2023-Team-8
This repository contains code, made during ESICM Datathon 2023. It includes code with EDA, dataset preparation for prediction model and for simulation model.
During Datathon simulation model of ICU bed occupancy was created, the work was proceded to Grand Finale.
Datathon was held with data from AmsterdamUMCdb. This is the first freely accessible intensive care database from within the European Union containing de-identified health data related to tens of thousands of European intensive care unit admissions, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests and medications (https://amsterdammedicaldatascience.nl/amsterdamumcdb/).
Some parts of the code (espesially SQL queries) were taken from the official repository of AmsterdamUMCdb (https://github.com/AmsterdamUMC/AmsterdamUMCdb).
Data prepocessing was made to create a dataset for prediction modeling. Created prediction model has not ehought power to reliably predict LoS and needs to be refined.
Simulation model was created by Arash Ranjbar and is in his repository.
